key mappings
-esc: terminate program
- arrow keys: move the scene camera for all modes
-(m): change mode {0=scene, 1= rocket model}
-mode 0 is the architype rocket that I have made
-mode 1 is the scene that is generated (default is mode=1)
-(p): Change perspective mode {0=Orthogonal, 1=Perspective,3=First person}
-(+/-): change the dim parameter
-(z/x): change fov
-(w/s) move the camera forward or backwards from facing direction when in 
first person


3) the asignment took me about 5 hours to complete as I had some difficulty
in getting the first person navigation implemented.
